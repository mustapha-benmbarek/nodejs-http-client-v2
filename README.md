# Node.js : HTTP Fetch <img valign="bottom" align="right" height="40px" widht="40px" src="https://nodejs.org/static/images/logos/nodejs-new-pantone-black.png" />


### What is in there
This GitHub repository is just a simple program calling an external rest api with fetch module.


### What is Node.js
As an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications. Node.js is similar in design to, and influenced by, systems like Ruby's Event Machine and Python's Twisted. Node.js takes the event model a bit further. It presents an event loop as a runtime construct instead of as a library. In other systems, there is always a blocking call to start the event-loop. Typically, behavior is defined through callbacks at the beginning of a script, and at the end a server is started through a blocking call likeEventMachine::run(). In Node.js, there is no such start-the-event-loop call. Node.js simply enters the event loop after executing the input script. Node.js exits the event loop when there are no more callbacks to perform. This behavior is like browser JavaScript â€” the event loop is hidden from the user.
